As for primary major tree species in these areas, Neota would have spruce/fir (type 1), 
while Rawah and Comanche Peak would probably have lodgepole pine (type 2) as their primary species, followed by spruce/fir and aspen (type 5). 
Cache la Poudre would tend to have Ponderosa pine (type 3), Douglas-fir (type 6), and cottonwood/willow (type 4). 

The Rawah and Comanche Peak areas would tend to be more typical of the overall dataset than either the Neota or Cache la Poudre, 
due to their assortment of tree species and range of predictive variable values (elevation, etc.)
Cache la Poudre would probably be more unique than the others, due to its relatively low elevation range and species composition.


we have been given a total of 54 attributes/features, these attributes contain Binary and Quantitative attributes,
and we need to predict which Forest Cover-Type is it from the given features.
Given is the attribute name, attribute type, the measurement unit and a brief description.
The forest cover type is the classification problem. The order of this listing corresponds to the order of numerals along the rows of the database.
